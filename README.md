   - Check if your Groq account has available quota
   - Try regenerating your API key in Groq Console

2. **Slow Responses**:
   - Switch to a faster model like llama-3.1-8b-instant
   - Ensure good internet connectivity
   - Try simpler, more concise commands

3. **Incorrect Responses**:
   - Be more specific in your commands
   - Try breaking complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Disable Agent Mode for pure language tasks

### Screenpipe Terminator Issues

1. **Agent Not Connecting**:
   - Verify Terminator agent is running (check system tray)
   - Restart the agent if it's unresponsive
   - Ensure you've granted necessary permissions

2. **Automation Failures**:
   - Use screen capture to provide visual context
   - Be more specific about target applications
   - Try alternate command phrasing
   - Ensure target application is fully loaded before issuing commands

3. **Permission Issues**:
   - Grant accessibility permissions to Terminator
   - Allow screen recording access
   - Check OS-specific security settings

### Voice Recognition Issues

1. **Microphone Not Working**:
   - Check browser permissions for microphone access
   - Use Chrome for best compatibility
   - Speak clearly and at moderate volume
   - Reduce background noise

2. **Speech Not Recognized**:
   - Check if correct language is selected
   - Speak more slowly and clearly
   - Try using text commands as a fallback

## Security & Privacy

### Data Storage

- **API Keys**: Stored in browser localStorage, not sent to any servers except the official API endpoints.
- **Command History**: Stored locally in your browser.
- **Voice Data**: Processed locally and via Groq API, not permanently stored.
- **Screen Captures**: Processed locally and via Screenpipe, not permanently stored.

### Privacy Features

- **Redaction**: Screenpipe can be configured to automatically blur sensitive information.
- **Local Processing**: Screen and voice data are processed locally when possible.
- **Selective Capturing**: Capture only specific areas of the screen when needed.
- **No Cloud Storage**: Your data isn't stored in the cloud beyond the processing needed for AI functionality.

### Best Practices

1. Don't use GroqFlow for highly sensitive information.
2. Regularly clear browser data and localStorage if using on shared computers.
3. Disable screen capture when working with sensitive documents.
4. Review and understand the permissions granted to Screenpipe Terminator.
